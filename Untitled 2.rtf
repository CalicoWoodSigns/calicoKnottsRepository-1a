\f0\fs24 \cf0 Call code that we have right now is connecting to the other database just fine my question is can we code these pages so that it will test to see whether it's local or remote and dynamically make the changes to connect to the database I only want to use one database and I want to be able to connect to it locally and remote that way any changes I make locally will show up on the remote they both access the same database}
